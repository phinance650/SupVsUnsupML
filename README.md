# Data Exploration Project

This project focuses on exploring large datasets using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. It includes two Jupyter notebooks:

- **KMeansClustering.ipynb**: Implements K-Means clustering to classify data into distinct clusters based on features.
- **SVM.ipynb**: Uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for supervised classification.

## Project Structure

- `KMeansClustering.ipynb` - Notebook for unsupervised clustering using the K-Means algorithm.
- `SVM.ipynb` - Notebook for supervised classification using SVM.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib`

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phinance650/DataExploration.git
